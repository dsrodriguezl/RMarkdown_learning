# Making a table

With the *"df_print: kable"*  any data frame that is printed inside the document is printed as a table using *"knitr::kable()"*.
For example by printing the head of the data frame of the **"cars"** data set, which is printed here with the *`` `r ` ``*  inline code command:

`r cars %>% head`
