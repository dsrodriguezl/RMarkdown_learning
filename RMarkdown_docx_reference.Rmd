Paragraph 1 of normal text, it is extended to two lines in purpose to check the format of the space in between lines of the same paragraph.

Paragraph 2 of normal text, it is extended to two lines in purpose to check the format of the space in between lines of the same paragraph.

Citations can be inserted in text, with ease by using the Zotero citation key(s) (`@citation_key`) of the source(s) to cite. A citation at the end of the sentence is easily applied with `[@citation_key]`. For example by citing my own first paper at the end of this sentence [@rodriguezleonVariacionAbundanciaRelativa2019]. The previous sentence looks like this **`For example by citing my own first paper by the end of this sentence [@rodriguezleonVariacionAbundanciaRelativa2019]`** in the RMarkdown document. Meanwhile, a citation as the noun of the sentence can be inserted by using `@citation_key`. Here, @rodriguezleonVariacionAbundanciaRelativa2019 is again an example of this, which looks like this **`rodriguezleonVariacionAbundanciaRelativa2019 is again an example of this`** in the RMarkdown document.

# Making a table

With the *"df_print: kable"*  any data frame that is printed inside the document is printed as a table using *"knitr::kable()"*.
For example by printing the head of the data frame of the **"cars"** data set, which is printed here with the *`` `r ` ``*  inline code command:

`r cars %>% head`

For the bibliography, it is only required to have a last section in the document with the "Bibliography"or "References" title. The bibliography will by automatically inserted from the specified BibTex (.bib) file in the YAML section of the RMarkdown document (e.g. `` bibliography: references.bib  ``), which should be stored in the same directory folder as the corresponding RMarkdown document file.
