## R Markdown - ioslides html presentation

This is an R Markdown presentation that renders into an ioslides html presentation file.
A new slide starts at each first or second level header. Alternatively, a manual slide break can be inserted with a horizontal rule (``***``), just as it will be done here.

Also, with | a subtitle can be added to a slide.

This is shown in the next slide.
